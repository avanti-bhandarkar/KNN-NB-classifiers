# Comparison of classification algorithms (KNN and Naïve Bayes)

This repository was created for the mini-project ICA component of our Machine Learning course.

The data used for all scripts is from the [student alcohol consumption dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption), from UCI Machine Learning.

This project was made by Avanti Bhandarkar (C008), Aditya Kamath (C021) and Chetan Popli (C032)
